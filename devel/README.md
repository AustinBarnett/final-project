# Instructions for Running my Project

In order to run this program I wanted to make everything as simple as possible for everyone to use. When it comes to running this program you will not have to install anything form the pip/pip3. The program will automatically pull in the time.sleep at the beginning so the program can have the stalls I desire. All you have to do to use the program is run it and then answer the questions when prompted. When asking a question please write it the same way you would ask it with proper grammar and a question mark at the end, thank you!
