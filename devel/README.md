# Instructions for Running my Project

In order to run this program I wanted to make everything as simple as possible for everyone to use. When it comes to running this program you will not have to install anything form the pip/pip3. The program will automatically pull in the time.sleep at the beginning so the program can have the stalls I desire. All you have to do to use the program is run it and then answer the questions when prompted. When responding to the questions the user will have to give responses as simple or diverse as they want. In the end it is impossible to truly guess someones emotional state so a random answer could or could not be true but I do believe the outcomes of our day depend on what we think of.
