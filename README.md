# Final Project for COP 1000

You'll have two weeks to complete this project. The first week will be spent scoping out your project with the help of your classmates and instructor. Your second week will be spent coding your project. More details are provided below.

## About The Final Project Repository

The final project repository housed [here](https://github.com/valencia-cop1000-201620/final-project/) will maintain conversations about the project. Additionally, you'll fork and clone the class repository to your **personal** GitHub account. This is where you'll create your files and you'll submit them for grading via a pull request, as we've done in past projects.

## Week 1

Your goals for Week 1 of the final project should be:
* narrow down the topic of your final project
* create a proposal for your final project
* solicit feedback from classmates
* get final approval :+1: from instructor
* provide feedback to classmates on their proposal
* create a rough design of your final project

### :bangbang: Deliverables for Week 1
 To achieve your week 1 goals, turn in the following:

- [ ] Fork this project.
  * You'll then be able to check off the items on this list, but only on your own fork.

- [ ] Create an **Issue** with your project proposal.
  * On the final project repository, create an **Issue** titled: `yourusername's Final Project Proposal`.
  * The **Issue** will automatically populate with some fields for you to fill in. Answer the questions that autopopulate.
  * Feel free to write add comments about what you'd like some feedback from classmates or the professor on.

- [ ] Provide feedback to ** Issues ** opened by your classmates. Some useful feedback would be:
  * does the project seem like too much work to be done in 1 week? If not, how could you suggest the project be modified so it fits into the given timeframe?
  * what obstacles might your classmate have missed?
  * does the project utilize topics learned throughout the semester?
  * does your classmate describe a general plan for achieving his/her desired project? the plan could be an outline, diagram, drawing, written description of programming structure, pseudocode, etc.


- [ ] Keep an eye on your notifications so that you can continue conversations on your own **Issue** but also on the **Issues** in which you have given feedback. When you receive a :+1: from the professor, you can begin implementing.

## Week 2

Your goals for Week 2 of the final project should be:
* finalize your design from Week 1
* implement your final project (this is the coding portion!)
* solicit feedback from classmates
* provide feedback to classmates

- [ ] Fork the `final-project` repository. This will create a personal copy of the repository on your GitHub account.

- [ ] Clone the `final-project` repository. This will download a copy of the repo to your computer so you can begin adding files.

- [ ] Formalize the design you discussed in Week 1 by adding one or more files to the `design` folder. These files can be outlines, diagrams, written descriptions of programming structure, pseudocode, or anything that helps you plan out ** BEFORE ** you begin coding.

- [ ] Add your python program to the `devel` folder.

- [ ] Add a `README` file to your `devel` folder explaining, in detail, how to run your program. Include a detailed description, screenshots, requires modules (if any need to be installed), etc. Anything a complete stranger would need to get your program running.
